# `private`, `protected`, `public`. 

So far, you have encountered `private` and `public` levels of access. You will encounter `protected` in the next workbook. 

- `private` – cannot be accessed outside the class.
- `public` – accessible from everywhere.
- `protected` – accessible to child classes. Favor `protected` over `public` if **only** the child classes need access to a particular method.
